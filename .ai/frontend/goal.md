I want to build a frontend for a DEFI portfolio manager based on agents which I already have in @agents folder and terminal based chat app which I have in @index.js.

I want to start small - create a Typescript React app with Vite and Tailwind CSS. All app source files will be in ./frontend folder, but dependencies will be installed in the root, package.json is also in the root.

I made a simple prototype of the app using v0.dev, here is the link: https://v0.dev/chat/chat-gpt-chat-0QQM9GNxVaS?b=b_9KpvHSsHleF&p=0

Let's create a step by step plan for the setting this app up.
