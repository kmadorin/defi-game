Track Description:
AgentKit by Coinbase Developer Platform allows anyone to give their AI agents access to a crypto wallet and onchain interactions with a comprehensive set of actions and plug-and-play integrations with top frameworks. Allow your agents to send USDC fee-free, deploy custom smart contracts and tokens, or interact in the wide world of DeFi.
CDP SDK is a powerful tool for programmatic blockchain access through easy-to-use APIs. It allows builders to create onchain applications without worrying about the intricacies of blockchain development.
Onramp allows you to easily onboard fiat into crypto using Apple Pay and common payment mechanisms, while Coinbase Commerces lets merchants easily accept crypto.
Use the MPC Wallet APIs to create programmable, secure, and powerful experiences that abstract wallet interaction away from users, perform complex orchestration tasks, and facilitate onchain AI agent execution.
